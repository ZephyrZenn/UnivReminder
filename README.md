# UnivReminder

This is a tool for synchronizing your canvas todo list to apple reminder.

It's too cumbersome to log in to canvas every time you want to check your work, especially after IT department adding a useless 2FA authentication ):. 

This repository helps you to sync all assignment to your apple reminder and no need for you to move away from computer, get your phone and input the 2FA code.

*The program would build a cli tool and you can launch it when necessary or just let it run background*
